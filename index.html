       <h2 class="titleone">Animation Isn't Easy!</h2>

<p>    I'm finally planning to start learning how to animate, but... animation is hard. I'm not sure if most people understand how much work goes into it! 
       Typically, one second of animation involves 24 frames. Meaning, a 5 second animation is essentially 120 drawings. 
       For someone like me who doesn't have a strong grasp of anatomy, the troubles don't stop there. Coloring and rendering are another huge step. The time consuming process of color filling each frame prolongs the process. But despite all this, I'm willing to try my best. I think if we are passionate about things, we'll tolerate its shortcomings a lot easier. </p>
<p>   Anyways, time for random filler text again! > But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, 
       or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

       <h2 class= titleone>What Dedication Means</h2>

<p>    I don't remember how I found this YouTuber, but I'm wondering if it'd be hyperbolic if I said he changed my life? 
       James Scholz is a computer engineering student who studied for 12 hours everyday, for a year. These study hours are inevitable for students in countries with competitive education systems. 
       Anyway, what amazes is the dedication James puts in, with such consistancy. I've never in my life put my all into something, I wonder what it feels like to go all out? Watching his videos made me realise the importance of seriously working hard. 
       The work is the bridge between your goal and where you are. But it's easier said than done. You can listen to others rattle on for hours about the "grind" or the "hustle", but I've learned the hard way - 
       watching a few motivational videos and filling your walls with inspiring quotes won't change your life. </p>
